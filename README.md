Logical Argument and Ciphering Project
Project Overview
This project is divided into four main tasks, each addressing different logical and computational challenges, such as truth table generation, digital logic circuit simplification, and encryption/decryption using the Affine cipher. The tasks are implemented in C++ and involve logical expressions, circuits, and cryptography.
